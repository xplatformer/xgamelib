# XPlatformer Framework #
***
#### Description
Developed as a part of the XPlatformer project, the *References* folder contains a series of helper classes and functions that act as wrappers for commonly used XLib functions or sequences of operations.   Specifically the framework assists in the handling of window operations, graphics context and visual drawing.   The framework more broadly assists in handling input, logging, mathematics and game organization.

##### Compile Instructions

To make ("compile and link") using the framework, use the included makefile as an example.  In order to properly link the line `-I../References` must be included in the compile path. For example, to make null.cpp:

	g++ -o null null.cpp -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -I../References -lstdc++
